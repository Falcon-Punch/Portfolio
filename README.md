# Portfolio

This is a portfolio website that I decided to create in order to organize all of my coding projects into one place and visually
show them to potential employers or clients. I also used this opportunity to get more familiar with technologies
such as:

* HTML5 / CSS
* Bootstrap
* JavaScript
* jQuery
